            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <p> • 1 1/4 cups milk</p>
            <p> • 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</p>
            <p> • 2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
            <p> • 3/4 teaspoon salt</p>
            <p> • 1/2 pound chicken breasts</p>
            <p> • 1 (14 1/2-ounce) can chicken broth</p>
            <p> • 2 tablespoons vegetable oil</p>
            <p> • 1 cup minced onion</p>
            <p> • 2 cloves garlic</p>
            <p> • 1/2 cup finely diced red bell pepper</p>
            <p> • 1 chicken bouillon cube</p>
            <p> • 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</p>
            <p> • 1/3 cup milk, or cream</p>
            <p> • 1/4 cup grated mozzarella cheese</p>
            <p> • 1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese</p>
            <p> • 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</p>
            <p> • Salt, to taste</p>
            <p> • Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</p>
            <p> • 2 large eggs</p>
            <p> • 1 1/2 cups breadcrumbs</p>
            <p> • 6 cups vegetable oil, for frying</p>

            <h2>Steps to Make It</h2>

            <p>1. Place milk, butter, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a small saucepan. Bring just to a boil, then slowly stir in the flour with a wooden spoon until you have a stiff batter.</p>
            <p>2. Continue to stir over heat for 2 to 3 minutes more, until well mixed, then remove from heat and set aside to cool.</p>
            <p>3. Place the chicken breasts in a larger saucepan and cover with water or chicken stock. Cover, bring to a gentle boil and poach chicken until it's just cooked through about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool, reserving cooking liquid.</p>
            <p>4. Shred chicken into very small pieces when cool enough to handle (you can use a food processor with the plastic blade for this).</p>
            <p>5. Cook the onion, garlic, and bell pepper in a couple of tablespoons of vegetable oil until they are soft and fragrant.</p>
            <p>6. Add the shredded chicken to the vegetables with 1 cup of the reserved chicken broth and the cube of chicken bouillon. Cook, stirring until most of the water is absorbed or evaporated.</p>
            <p>7. Stir 2 tablespoons of flour into the chicken mixture and cook for 1 minute. Stir in the milk and cook until mixture is thickened and creamy. Remove from heat and stir in the cheeses. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</p>
            <p>8. Knead the milk and flour dough lightly, adding a little more flour if necessary, until smooth. Pinch off a small piece and roll it on a lightly floured surface into a 4-inch circle (about 2 millimeters thick). Continue with remaining dough, stacking the circles of dough as you go. (Or roll out half the dough into a large rectangle and cut circles with a large round cookie or biscuit cutter, then repeat with the other half of the dough).</p>
            <p>9. Place about 1 tablespoon of the chicken mixture inside each circle of dough, and fold in half to close. Seal edges firmly.</p>
            <p>10. In a shallow bowl, whisk the eggs together with a 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon sugar. Place the bread crumbs in another shallow bowl.</p>
            <p>11. Dip each pastry into the egg wash, and then into the bread crumbs. Set aside on a plate.</p>
            <p>12. Heat 2 inches of oil in a heavy skillet with tall sides to 350 F.</p>
            <p>13. Fry the risoles in batches until they are golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Serve warm.</p>
            <p>14. Risoles may be kept warm (or reheated) in a 200 F oven for up to an hour. Risoles may be prepared and breaded, then refrigerated for several hours before frying.</p>
